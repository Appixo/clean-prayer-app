# Privacy Policy – Namaz Vakitleri

**Last updated:** February 2025

Namaz Vakitleri ("we", "our", or "the app") is a prayer times application. This policy describes how we handle your information.

## Location data

**We use your location data solely to calculate prayer times and Qibla direction locally on your device. This data is not transmitted to external servers for tracking purposes.**

- **Prayer times:** Your coordinates (or the coordinates of a city you choose) are used only on the device to compute prayer times.
- **Qibla direction:** Your location is used only on the device to show the direction of the Kaaba.
- **Saved locations:** Cities and coordinates you save are stored only on your device (e.g. in app storage). We do not send this data to our own or third‑party servers for tracking or profiling.

When you use **city search**, the app may send the search text (e.g. a city name) to a third‑party geocoding service (e.g. OpenStreetMap Nominatim) to find matching cities and their coordinates. No continuous location tracking or transmission of your precise location is performed for advertising or tracking purposes.

## Other data

- **Notification preferences and settings** (e.g. adhan on/off, calculation method) are stored only on your device.
- We do not collect, store, or transmit personal data to our own servers. We do not use analytics or tracking that identifies you.

## Changes

We may update this policy from time to time. The "Last updated" date at the top will be revised when we do. Continued use of the app after changes means you accept the updated policy.

## Contact

If you have questions about this policy, please open an issue or contact the maintainers via the project repository (e.g. GitHub).
